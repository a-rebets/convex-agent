# Convex Agent Component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2fagent.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@convex-dev%2fagent)

Convex provides powerful building blocks for building agentic AI applications,
leveraging Components and existing Convex features.

With Convex, you can separate your long-running agentic workflows from your UI,
without the user losing reactivity and interactivity.

```sh
npm i @convex-dev/agent
```

AI Agents, built on Convex.
[Check out the docs here](https://docs.convex.dev/agents).

The Agent component is a core building block for building AI agents. It manages
threads and messages, around which you Agents can cooperate in static or dynamic
workflows.

- [Agents](./docs/getting-started.mdx) provide an abstraction for using LLMs to
  represent units of use-case-specific prompting with associated models,
  prompts, [Tool Calls](./docs/tools.mdx), and behavior in relation to other
  Agents, functions, APIs, and more.
- [Threads](./docs/threads.mdx) persist [messages](./docs/messages.mdx) and can
  be shared by multiple users and agents (including
  [human agents](./docs/human-agents.mdx)).
- Streaming text and objects using deltas over websockets so all clients stay in
  sync efficiently, without http streaming. Enables streaming from async
  functions.
- [Conversation context](./docs/context.mdx) is automatically included in each
  LLM call, including built-in hybrid vector/text search for messages in the
  thread and opt-in search for messages from other threads (for the same
  specified user).
- [RAG](./docs/rag.mdx) techniques are supported for prompt augmentation from
  other sources, either up front in the prompt or as tool calls. Integrates with
  the [RAG Component](https://www.convex.dev/components/rag), or DIY.
- [Workflows](./docs/workflows.mdx) allow building multi-step operations that
  can span agents, users, durably and reliably.
- [Files](./docs/files.mdx) are supported in thread history with automatic
  saving to [file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage) and
  ref-counting.
- [Debugging](./docs/debugging.mdx) is enabled by callbacks, the
  [agent playground](./docs/playground.mdx) where you can inspect all metadata
  and iterate on prompts and context settings, and inspection in the dashboard.
- [Usage tracking](./docs/usage-tracking.mdx) is easy to set up, enabling usage
  attribution per-provider, per-model, per-user, per-agent, for billing & more.
- [Rate limiting](./docs/rate-limiting.mdx), powered by the
  [Rate Limiter Component](https://www.convex.dev/components/rate-limiter),
  helps control the rate at which users can interact with agents and keep you
  from exceeding your LLM provider's limits.
